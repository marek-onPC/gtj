                <p class="normal-text mt-5">The kanji that make up Japan's name mean 'sun origin', and it is often called the "Land of the Rising Sun".

                <p class="normal-text mt-5">The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands.</p> 
                <ul class="normal-text">
                  <li>The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.
                  </li>
                  <li>In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.
                  </li>
                  <li>The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. 
                  </li>
                  <li>The Ryukyu Islands and Nanpō Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.
                  </li>

                <p class="normal-text">Every country have a different visa condition (it depends on agreement between specific country and Japan), but mostly, in tourist purposes many countries have a 90-days trourist visa agreement, which you can obtain at the airport.</p>
                <p class="normal-text mt-2">According to <span class="font-italic">U.S. DEPARTMENT of STATE — BUREAU of CONSULAR AFFAIRS</span> :</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="normal-text mb-2">You must have a valid passport and an onward/return ticket for tourist/business "visa free" stays of up to 90 days. Your passport must be valid for the entire time you are staying in Japan.
                    </li>
                    <li class="normal-text mb-2">You cannot work on a 90-day "visa free" entry.
                    </li>
                    <li class="normal-text mb-2">"Visa free" entry status may not be changed to another visa status without departing and then re-entering Japan with the appropriate visa, such as a spouse, work, or study visa.
                    </li>
                    <li class="normal-text mb-2">Japanese immigration officers may deny you entry if you appear to have no visible means of support. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="normal-text mb-2">All foreign nationals are required to provide fingerprint scans and to be photographed at the port of entry. Exceptions to this requirement include diplomatic and official visa holders, minors, and individuals covered under SOFA Article IX.2. For further information about landing procedures, please visit the Immigration Bureau of Japan’s website. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="normal-text mb-2"> Make sure your passport is valid. Japanese immigration occasionally encounters U.S. travelers attempting to enter Japan on a passport that had been reported lost or stolen and denies entry to such travelers. In many of these cases the U.S. citizen traveler claims they are traveling on a passport that they had previously lost and reported as lost or stolen, but then subsequently found and used for travel. If you have reported your passport lost or stolen, you must apply for a new passport before travel.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4 class="mb-2 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Baggage</h4>

                  <p class="normal-text">Because of in mostly hotels and guesthouses (in my case - always), toilet stuff like shampoo, body soap or hairdryer are aviable all the time, so you don't need to bring them - you can save a lot of space in your baggage!</p>
                  <p class="normal-text">Second thing is electricity, there are type A and B sockets in Japan and the standard voltage is 100 V with 50 / 60 Hz frequency. It means that if you are traveling from country with other type of plugs, probably you will need to by adapter, which you can buy easly in conbinis.</p>
                  <p class="normal-text">Of course you also should be prepared for different types of weather in Japan. Take care that on mainland and southern parts of Japan summers are hot and humidity is very high, and when it comes to winter - Okinawa is quite warm, but in northen parts of the country, for sure you will see a lot of snow.</p>
                  <p class="normal-text">Little advice - because sun is very strong, avoid to wear tank-tops, you will get sunburns after first day. It's much better to wear standard t-shirt, also take care of buying small face towel (to wipe your face from sweat - that kind of towells are very popular in Japan during summer season) and umbrella due to weather likes to change couple times in a day!</p>

                <h4 class="mb-2 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Stay</h4>
                <p class="normal-text">It's good to take care about your stay before coming to Japan.
                  Sometimes it takes a little bit to find good place in a good location.
                  Also in a tourism peak period a lot of hotels and guest house are full.</p>
                <p class="normal-text mt-2">One of the most popular ways for both, cheap and comfortable stay during your trip are japanese hostels/guest houses.
                  They provide private beds with curtains to deliver more privacy in shared bedrooms.
                  Besides that, good idea is to consider capsule hotels.</p>
                  <h4 class="mb-2 mt-5 font-weight-bold">Commute</h4>
                  <p class="normal-text">Japan is well known from it's railway. Trains mostly come on time, commute is very easy due to different variety of bus, train or metro routes. In Tokyo one of the most popular way of going from one part of the city to another is metro, which have very well prepared routes all around the city and train usually runs for every 3-4 minutes.</p>
                  <p class="normal-text">Different cities are also well connected with buses or different type of railway systems like:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="normal-text mb-2">high speed trains Shinkansen - 新幹線</li>
                    <li class="normal-text mb-2">local high speed trains</li>
                    <li class="normal-text mb-2">regular local trains</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="normal-text">If you are planning to visit different cities during your stay it's good to consider Japan Rail Pass. It's special ticket for visitors (only on tourist visa!) which you should buy before comming to Japan (JR is under development of Japan-stores where you can buy JRPass, but price will be a little bit higher than usual). Is most cases it's much cheaper to buy this pass and not to worry about traveling with JR ans you can enter mostly every JR train (Only express Shinkansen lines are not covered with JRPass).</p>
